much.', \"They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\", '33 \\n\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.', 'He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.', 'Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.', 'The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.', '66\\n\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.', \"They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.\", \"Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.\", 'The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.', 'The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.', \"This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\", '78\\n\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.', 'Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.', '69\\n\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.', 'At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.', '\"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.', \"He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.\", 'It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map.', \"For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again.\", \"There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight.\", 'What could he have been thinking of?', 'It must have been a trick of the light.', 'Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.', 'It stared back.', 'As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.', \"It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs.\", 'Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind.', 'As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.', 'But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else.', \"As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.\", 'People in cloaks.', \"Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people!\", 'He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.', 'He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by.', 'They were whispering excitedly together.', \"Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak!\", 'The nerve of him!', 'But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... \\n\\nyes, that would be it.', 'http://www.yahoo.com  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.', 'Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.', \"If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning.\", \"He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.\", 'Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime.', 'Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning.', 'He yelled at five different people.', 'He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more.', \"He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\", \"He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's.\", 'He eyed them angrily as he passed.', \"He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy.\", \"This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.\", 'It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.', '\"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\" \\n\\nMr. Dursley stopped dead.', 'Fear flooded him.', 'He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.', 'He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind.', 'He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid.', \"Potter wasn't such an unusual name.\", 'He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.', \"Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry.\", \"He'd never even seen the boy.\", 'It might have been Harvey.', 'Or Harold.', 'There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.', \"He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...\", \"He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\", '\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.', 'It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak.', \"He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.\", 'On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!', 'Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last!', 'Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"', 'And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.', 'Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.', 'He had been hugged by a complete stranger.', 'He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was.', 'He was rattled.', \"He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.\", \"As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning.\", 'It was now sitting on his garden wall.', 'He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.', '\"Shoo!\"', 'said Mr. Dursley loudly.', \"The cat didn't move.\", 'It just gave him a stern look.', 'Was this normal cat behavior?', 'Mr. Dursley wondered.', 'Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house.', 'He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.', 'Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day.', 'She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\").', 'Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.', 'When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\'s owls have been behaving very unusually today.', 'Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.', 'Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\"', 'The newscaster allowed himself a grin.', '\"Most mysterious.', 'And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather.', 'Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"', '\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today.', \"Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars!\", \"Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks!\", 'But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"', 'Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair.', 'Shooting stars all over Britain?', 'Owls flying by daylight?', 'Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?', 'And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters... \\n\\nMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea.', 'It was no good.', \"He'd have to say something to her.\", 'He cleared his throat nervously.', '\"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\\'t heard from your sister lately, have you?\"', 'As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry.', \"After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\", '\"No,\" she said sharply.', '\"Why?\"', 'http://www.yahoo.com \\n\\n\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled.', '\"Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\" \\n\\n\"So?\"', 'snapped Mrs. Dursley.', '\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.\"', 'Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips.', 'Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\\'d heard the name \"Potter.\"', \"He decided he didn't dare.\", 'Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he\\'d be about Dudley\\'s age now, wouldn\\'t he?\"', '\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.', '\"What\\'s his name again?', 'Howard, isn\\'t it?\"', 'http://www.google.com \\n\\n\"Harry.', 'Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"', '\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.', '\"Yes, I quite agree.\"', \"He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\", 'While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden.', 'The cat was still there.', 'It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.', 'Was he imagining things?', 'Could all this have anything to do with the Potters?', \"If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it.\", 'The Dursleys got into bed.', 'Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind.', 'His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley.', 'The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....', \"He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them.... \\n\\nHow very wrong he was.\", 'Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness.', 'It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive.', \"It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.\", 'In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.', \"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.\", \"The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\", 'Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive.', 'He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.', 'He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.', 'His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice.', \"This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\", \"Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.\", 'He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something.', 'But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street.', 'For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.', 'He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"', 'He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.', 'It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.', 'He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.', 'The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.', 'He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness.', 'Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.', \"If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.\", 'Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.', \"He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\", '\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"', 'He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.', 'Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.', 'She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.', 'Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun.', 'She looked distinctly ruffled.', '\"How did you know it was me?\"', 'she asked.', '\"My dear Professor, I \\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"', '\"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"All day?', 'When you could have been celebrating?', 'I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"', 'Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.', '\"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.', '\"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something\\'s going on.', 'It was on their news.\"', \"She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window.\", '\"I heard it.', \"Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid.\", 'They were bound to notice something.', \"Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle.\", 'He never had much sense.\"', '\"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently.', '\"We\\'ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"', '\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably.', '\"But that\\'s no reason to lose our heads.', 'People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"', \"She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on.\", '\"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all.', 'I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\"', '\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"We have much to be thankful for.', 'Would you care for a lemon drop?\"', '\"A what?\"', '\"A lemon drop.', 'They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of\" \\n\\n\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\'t think this was the moment for lemon drops.', '\"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -\" \\n\\n\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name?', 'All this \\'You- Know-Who\\' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\"', 'Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.', '\"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\'', \"I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\", '\"I know you haven \\'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.', '\"But you\\'re different.', 'Everyone knows you\\'re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"', '\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly.', '\"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\"', '\"Only because you\\'re too -- well -- noble to use them.\"', '\"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark.', 'I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"', 'Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around.', \"You know what everyone's saying?\", \"About why he's disappeared?\", 'About what finally stopped him?\"', 'It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.', 'It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.', 'Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.', '\"What they\\'re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\'s Hollow.', 'He went to find the Potters.', \"The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead.\", '“ \\n\\nDumbledore bowed his head.', 'Professor McGonagall gasped.', '\"Lily and James...', \"I can't believe it...\", 'I didn\\'t want to believe it... \\n\\nOh, Albus...\" \\n\\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder.', '\"I know...', 'I know...\" he said heavily.', \"Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on.\", '\"That\\'s not all.', \"They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry.\", \"But -- he couldn't.\", \"He couldn't kill that little boy.\", \"No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.\", 'Dumbledore nodded glumly.', '\"It\\'s -- it\\'s true?\"', 'faltered Professor McGonagall.', '\"After all he\\'s done... all the people he\\'s killed... he couldn\\'t kill a little boy?', 'It\\'s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\"', '\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"We may never know.\"', 'Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.', 'Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it.', 'It was a very odd watch.', 'It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge.', 'It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\\'s late.', 'I suppose it was he who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to tell me why you\\'re here, of all places?\"', '\"I\\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.', 'They\\'re the only family he has left now.\"', '\"You don\\'t mean -- you can\\'t mean the people who live here?\"', 'cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.', '\"Dumbledore -- you can\\'t.', \"I've been watching them all day.\", \"You couldn't find two people who are less like us.\", \"And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.\", 'Harry Potter come and live here!\"', '\"It\\'s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly.', '\"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\'s older.', 'I\\'ve written them a letter.\"', '\"A letter?\"', 'repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall.', '\"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?', 'These people will never understand him!', 'He\\'ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!\"', '\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.', '\"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head.', 'Famous before he can walk and talk!', \"Famous for something he won't even remember!\", 'CarA you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\"', 'Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes -- yes, you\\'re right, of course.', 'But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\"', 'She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.', '\"Hagrid\\'s bringing him.\"', '\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\"', 'I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"I\\'m not saying his heart isn\\'t in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\'t pretend he\\'s not careless.', 'He does tend to -- what was that?\"', 'A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them.', 'It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.', 'If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.', 'He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.', 'He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.', 'In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.', '\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.', '\"At last.', 'And where did you get that motorcycle?\"', '\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke.', '\"Young Sirius Black lent it to me.', 'I\\'ve got him, sir.\"', '\"No problems, were there?\"', '\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\\' around.', 'He fell asleep as we was flyin\\' over Bristol.\"', 'Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets.', 'Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.', 'Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.', '\"Is that where -?\"', 'whispered Professor McGonagall.', '\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"', '\"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"', '\"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t.', 'Scars can come in handy.', 'I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground.', 'Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we\\'d better get this over with.\"', \"Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.\", '\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\"', 'asked Hagrid.', 'He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.', 'Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.', '\"Shhh!\"', 'hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"', '\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it.', '\"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it -- Lily an\\' James dead -- an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\" \\n\\n\"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.', \"He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two.\", \"For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.\", '\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that.', \"We've no business staying here.\", 'We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\'ll be takin\\' Sirius his bike back.', 'G\\'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"', 'Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.', '\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her.', 'Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.', 'Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.', 'On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer.', 'He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.', 'He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.', '\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured.', 'He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.', 'A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen.', 'Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up.', \"One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley...\", 'He couldn\\'t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"', 'CHAPTER TWO THE VANISHING GLASS \\n\\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.', \"The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.\", 'Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.', 'Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the

glasses.', \"Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.\", \"Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange

into the car in front.', 'He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\"', 'Dudley and Piers sniggered.', 'I know they don\\'t,\" said Harry.', '\"It was only a dream.\"', \"But he wished he hadn't said anything.\", \"If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\", 'It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.', 'The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.', \"It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,

get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him.\", \"They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\", 'Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.',

over bits of wood and stone.', 'Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.', 'Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place.', \"It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood.\", 'In fact, it was fast asleep.', 'Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.', '\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father.', \"Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge.\", '\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered.',

intently at the snake.', \"He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.\",

watching.', \"They weren't.\", 'He looked back at the snake and winked, too.', 'The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling.', 'It gave Harry a look

nodded vigorously.', '\"Where do you come from, anyway?\"', 'Harry asked.', 'The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass.', 'Harry peered at it.', 'Boa Constrictor, Brazil.', '\"Was it nice there?\"', 'The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.', '\"Oh, I see -- so you\\'ve never been to Brazil?\"', 'As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.', '\"DUDLEY!', 'MR.

sweet tea while he apologized over and over again.', 'Piers and Dudley could only gibber.', \"As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death.\", 'But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you, Harry?\"', 'Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry.', 'He was so angry he could hardly speak.', 'He managed to say, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.', 'Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch.', \"He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.\", \"Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\", \"He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.\", \"He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died.\", 'Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead.', \"This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from.\", \"He couldn't remember his parents at all.\", 'His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions.', 'There were no photographs of them in the house.', 'When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family.', 'Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him.', 'Very strange strangers they were, too.', 'A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley.',

way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.', 'At school, Harry had no one.', \"Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and

him.', 'The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.', 'He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.', 'He bowed as they walked inside.', 'Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn.', 'So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.', '\"Like I said, Yeh\\'d be mad

long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.', 'There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more

goblin\\'s book of numbers.', 'The goblin wrinkled his nose.', 'Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.', '\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.', 'The goblin looked at it closely.', '\"That seems to be in order.\"', '\"An\\' I\\'ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest.', '\"It\\'s about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\"', 'The goblin read the letter carefully.', '\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have

remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.', \"The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.\", \"Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open.\", 'Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.', 'I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what\\'s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"', '\"Stalagmite\\'s got an \\'m\\' in it,\" said Hagrid.', '\"An\\' don\\' ask me questions just now, I think I\\'m gonna be sick.\"', 'He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.', 'Griphook unlocked the door.', 'A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped.', 'Inside were mounds of gold coins.', 'Columns of silver.', 'Heaps of little bronze Knuts.', '\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.', \"All Harry's -- it was incredible.\", \"The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking.\", 'How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep?', 'And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.', 'Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.', '\"The gold ones are Galleons,\"

yeh.\"', 'He turned to Griphook.', '\"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\"', '\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.', 'They were going even deeper now and gathering speed.', 'The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.', 'They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.', 'Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.', '\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly.', 'He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.', '\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\'d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.', '\"How often do you check to see if anyone\\'s inside?\"', 'Harry asked.', '\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.', 'Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty.', 'Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.', 'Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat.', 'Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.', '\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\'t talk to me on the way back, it\\'s best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid.', 'One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.', \"Harry

of heads.\", '\"C\\'mon, follow me -- any more firs\\' years?', 'Mind yer step, now!', 'Firs\\' years follow me!\"', 'Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep,

onto the edge of a great black take.', 'Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.', '\"No more\\'n four

silent, staring up at the great castle overhead.', 'It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.', '\"Heads down!\"', 'yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.', 'They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.', '\"Oy, you there!', 'Is this your toad?\"', 'said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.', '\"Trevor!\"', 'cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands.', \"Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\", 'They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door.', '\"Everyone here?', 'You there, still got yer toad?\"', 'Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.', 'CHAPTER SEVEN THE SORTING HAT \\n\\nThe door swung open at once.', 'A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.', \"She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\", '\"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.',

lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.', 'They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.', 'Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.', 'They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.', '\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses.', 'The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts.', 'You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.', '\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.', 'Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.', 'While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points.', 'At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor.', 'I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.', '\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school.',

nose.\", 'Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.', '\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"Please wait quietly.\"', 'She left the chamber.', 'Harry swallowed.', '\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\"', 'he asked Ron.', '\"Some sort of test, I think.', 'Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"', \"Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt.\", 'A test?', 'In front of the whole school?', \"But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do?\", \"He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.\",

wondering which one she'd need.\", 'Harry tried hard not to listen to her.', \"He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue.\", 'He kept his eyes fixed on the door.', 'Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.', 'Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.', '\"What the --?\"', 'He gasped.', 'So did the people around him.', 'About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall.', 'Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years.', 'They seemed to be arguing.', 'What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --\" \\n\\n\"My dear Friar, haven\\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?', 'He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\\'s not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?\"', 'A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.', 'Nobody answered.', '\"New students!\"', 'said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them.', '\"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\"', 'A few people nodded mutely.', '\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\"', 'said the Friar.', '\"My old house, you know.\"', '\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice.', '\"The Sorting Ceremony\\'s about to start.\"', 'Professor McGonagall had returned.', 'One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.', '\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"', 'Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.', 'Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place.', 'It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.', 'These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets.', 'At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.', 'Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.', 'The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.', 'Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver.', 'Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.', 'He heard Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside.', 'I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\"', \"It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.\", 'Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.', \"On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat.\", 'This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty.', \"Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.\", 'Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too.', 'For a few seconds, there was complete silence.', 'Then the hat twitched.', 'A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty, But don\\'t judge on what you see, I\\'ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.', \"You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all.\", \"There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.\", \"You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.\", 'So put me on!', \"Don't be afraid!\", \"And don't get in a flap!\", 'You\\'re in safe hands (though I have none) For I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"', 'The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song.', 'It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.', '\"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\"', 'Ron whispered to Harry.', '\"I\\'ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"', 'Harry.', 'smiled weakly.', 'Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching.', \"The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment.\", 'If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.', 'Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.', '\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said.', '\"Abbott, Hannah!\"', 'A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down.', 'A moments pause -- \"HUFFLEPUFF!\"', 'shouted the hat.', 'The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.', 'Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.', '\"Bones, Susan!\"', '\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"', 'shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.', '\"Boot, Terry!\"', '\"RAVENCLAW!\"', 'The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \\n\\n\"', 'Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" \\n\\nbecame the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\\'s twin brothers catcalling.', '\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin.', \"Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.\", 'He was starting to feel definitely sick now.', 'He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.', 'He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to

more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.', 'They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.', 'Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.', 'Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.', 'Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.', 'Binns droned

zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.\", 'For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected

owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.', \"Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far.\", 'She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to

didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\", '\"Where on earth have you all been?\"', 'she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.', '\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.', 'They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.', 'It was a while before any of them said anything.', \"Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.\", '\"What do they think they\\'re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\"', 'said Ron finally.', '\"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"', 'Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.', '\"You don\\'t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\"', 'she snapped.', '\"Didn\\'t you see what it was standing on.', '\"The floor?\"', 'Harry suggested.', '\"I wasn\\'t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"', '\"No, not the floor.', 'It was standing on a trapdoor.', 'It\\'s obviously guarding something.\"', 'She stood up, glaring at them.', \"I hope you're pleased with yourselves.\", 'We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled.', 'Now, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m going to bed.\"', 'Ron stared after her, his mouth open.', '\"No, we don\\'t mind,\" he said.', '\"You\\'d think we dragged her along, wouldn\\'t you.', 'But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.', 'The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?', 'Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.', 'It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.', \"CHAPTER TEN HALLOWEEN \\n\\nMalfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.\", 'Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one.', 'In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.', '\"It\\'s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.', '\"Or both,\" said Harry.', \"But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\", 'Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.', 'All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.', 'Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.', 'All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.', \"As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.\", 'Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor.', 'They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.', 'Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.', \"It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one.\", \"Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.\", 'Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.', '\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\"', 'Ron moaned enviously.', '\"I\\'ve never even touched one.\"', 'They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.', 'Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.', '\"That\\'s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.', '\"You\\'ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\\'t allowed them.\"', \"Ron couldn't resist it.\", '\"It\\'s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\\'s a Nimbus Two Thousand.', 'What did you say you\\'ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\"', 'Ron grinned at Harry.', '\"Comets look flashy, but they\\'re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\"', '\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\'t afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back.', '\"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\"', \"Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.\", '\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\"', 'he squeaked.', '\"Potter\\'s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.', '\"Yes, yes, that\\'s right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.', '\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter.', 'And what model is it?\"', '\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\\'s face.', '\"And it\\'s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\'ve got it,\" he added.', \"Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion.\", '\"Well, it\\'s true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\'t stolen Neville\\'s Remembrall I wouln\\'t be on the team....\" \\n\\n\"So I suppose you think that\\'s a reward for breaking rules?\"', 'came an angry voice from just behind them.', \"Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.\", '\"I thought you weren\\'t speaking to us?\"', 'said Harry.', '\"Yes, don\\'t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\'s doing us so much good.\"', 'Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.', 'Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day.', \"It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night.\", 'He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.', '\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s bedspread.', 'Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.', 'Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.', \"As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field.\", 'Held never been inside the stadium before.', 'Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.', 'At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.', 'They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.', 'Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground.', 'What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field.', 'The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.', '\"Hey, Potter, come down!\\'', 'Oliver Wood had arrived.', 'fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm.', 'Harry landed next to him.', '\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting.', '\"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural.', 'I\\'m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\\'ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"', 'He opened the crate.', 'Inside were four different-sized balls.', '\"Right,\" said Wood.', '\"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\\'s not too easy to play.', 'There are seven players on each side.', 'Three of them are called Chasers.\"', '\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.', '\"This ball\\'s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood.', '\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.', 'Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops.', 'Follow me?\"', '\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" \\n\\nHarry recited.', '\"So -- that\\'s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\\'t it?\"', '\"What\\'s basketball?\"', 'said Wood curiously.', '\"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly.', '\"Now, there\\'s another player on each side who\\'s called the Keeper -I\\'m Keeper for Gryffindor.', 'I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\"', '\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all.', '\"And they play with the Quaffle.', 'Okay, got that.', 'So what are they for?\"', 'He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.', '\"I\\'ll show you now,\" said Wood.', '\"Take this.\"', 'He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.', '\"I\\'m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said.', '\"These two are the Bludgers.\"', 'He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle.', 'Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.', '\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry.', 'He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.', \"At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face.\", 'Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.', '\"See?\"', 'Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely.', '\"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms.', \"That's why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team.\", 'So -- think you\\'ve got all that?\"', '\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off.', '\"Very good,\" said Wood.', '\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\"', 'Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.', '\"Never at Hogwarts.', \"We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that.\", 'Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker.', \"That's you.\", 'And you don\\'t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open.\"', '\"Don\\'t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they\\'re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"', 'Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.', 'Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.', 'It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.', '\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\'s the most important ball of the lot.', \"It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see.\", \"It's the Seeker's job to catch it.\", \"You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.\", \"That's why Seekers get fouled so much.\", 'A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.', '\"Well, that\\'s it -- any questions?\"', 'Harry shook his head.', 'He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.', '\"We won\\'t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it\\'s too dark, we might lose it.', 'Let\\'s try you out with a few of these.\"', 'He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.', \"Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.\", \"After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.\", '\"That Quidditch cup\\'ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle.', '\"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons.\"', \"Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months.\", 'The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had.', 'His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.', 'On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.', \"Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom.\", 'Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice.', \"Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye).\", 'Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger.', 'It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.', \"She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.\", '\"Now, don\\'t forget that nice wrist movement we\\'ve been practicing!\"', 'squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.', '\"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick.', 'And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \\'s\\' instead of \\'f\\' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\"', 'It was very difficult.', 'Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.', 'Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.', \"Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.\", '\"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', 'he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.', '\"You\\'re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap.', '\"It\\'s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \\'gar\\' nice and long.\"', '\"You do it, then, if you\\'re so clever,\" Ron snarled.', 'Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', 'Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.', '\"Oh, well done!\"', 'cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.', '\"Everyone see here, Miss Granger\\'s done it!\"', 'Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.', '\"It\\'s no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she\\'s a nightmare, honestly.', '“ \\n\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him.', 'It was Hermione.', 'Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.', '\"I think she heard you.\"', '\"So?\"', 'said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.', '\"She must\\'ve noticed she\\'s got no friends.\"', \"Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon.\", \"On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.\", 'Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.', 'A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.', 'The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.', 'Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.', 'Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\'s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.\"', 'He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.', 'There was an uproar.', \"It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.\", '\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\"', 'Percy was in his element.', '\"Follow me!', 'Stick together, first years!', 'No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders!', 'Stay close behind me, now.', 'Make way, first years coming through!', 'Excuse me, I\\'m a prefect!\"', '\"How could a troll get in?\"', 'Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.', '\"Don\\'t ask me, they\\'re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron.', '\"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"', 'They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.', \"As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.\", '\"I\\'ve just thought -- Hermione.\"', '\"What about her?\"', '\"She doesn\\'t know about the troll.\"', 'Ron bit his lip.', '\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped.', '\"But Percy\\'d better not see us.\"', \"Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom.\", 'They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.', '\"Percy!\"', 'hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.', 'Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape.', 'He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.', '\"What\\'s he doing?\"', 'Harry whispered.', '\"Why isn\\'t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"', '\"Search me.\"', \"Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.\", '\"He\\'s heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.', '\"Can you smell something?\"', 'Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.', 'And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet.', 'Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them.', 'They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.', 'It was a horrible sight.', 'Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut.', 'It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet.', 'The smell coming from it was incredible.', 'It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.', 'The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.', 'It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.', '\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered.', '\"We could lock it in.\"', '\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.', \"They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it.\", 'With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.', '\\'Yes!\"', \"Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.\", '\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.', '\"It\\'s the girls\\' bathroom!\"', 'Harry gasped.', '\"Hermione!\"', 'they said together.', 'It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?', 'Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic.', 'Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.', 'Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.', 'The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.', '\"Confuse it!\"', 'Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.', 'The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.', 'It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise.', 'Its mean little eyes saw Harry.', 'It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.', '\"Oy, pea-brain!\"', 'yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it.', \"The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\", '\"Come on, run, run!\"', \"Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.\", 'The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.', 'It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.', \"Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind.\", \"The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.\", 'Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.', 'Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', \"The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head.\", 'The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.', 'Harry got to his feet.', 'He was shaking and out of breath.', 'Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.', 'It was Hermione who spoke first.', '\"Is it -- dead?\"', 'I don\\'t think so,\" said Harry, I think it\\'s just been knocked out.\"', \"He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose.\", 'It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.', '\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"', \"He wiped it on the troll's trousers.\", 'A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.', \"They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars.\", 'A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear.', 'Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.', 'Snape bent over the troll.', 'Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry.', 'Harry had never seen her look so angry.', 'Her lips were white.',

at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.', '\"You\\'re lucky you weren\\'t killed.', 'Why aren\\'t you in your dormitory?\"', 'Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look.', 'Harry looked at the floor.', 'He wished Ron would put his wand down.', 'Then a small voice came out of the shadows.', '\"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\"', '\"Miss Granger!\"', 'Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.', 'I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I\\'ve read all about them.\"', 'Ron dropped his wand.', 'Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?', '\"If they hadn\\'t found me, I\\'d be dead now.', 'Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.',

case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\"', 'Hermione hung her head.', 'Harry was speechless.', 'Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.', 'It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.', '\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"I\\'m very disappointed in you.', \"If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower.\", 'Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\"', 'Hermione left.', 'Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.', '\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll.', 'You each win Gryffindor five points.', 'Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this.', 'You may go.\"', \"They hurried out of the chamber

points,\" Ron grumbled.', '\"Five, you mean, once she\\'s taken off Hermione\\'s.\"', '\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted.', '\"Mind you, we did save her.\"', '\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn\\'t locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him.', 'They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.', '\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.', 'The common room was packed and noisy.', 'Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up.', 'Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.', 'There was a very embarrassed pause.', 'Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.', 'But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend.', \"There are some things you can't share

match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.', 'If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.', 'Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret.', \"But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.\", 'It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend.', \"He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do.\", 'She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.', 'Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.', 'Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.',

thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table.', 'These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.', \"Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice.\", \"Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\", 'Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey.', 'Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice.', \"Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\", 'When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.', \"The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.\", 'Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.', 'Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.', \"He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.\", \"After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.\", \"It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever.\", 'Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day.', 'Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.', \"Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster.\", 'Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.', \"His father's... this had been his father's.\", 'He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air.', 'Use it well, the note had said.', 'He had to try it, now.', 'He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself.', 'Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.', 'It was a very funny feeling.', 'Use it well.', 'Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake.', 'The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak.', 'Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence.', 'He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.', 'Ron grunted in his sleep.', 'Should Harry wake him?', \"Something held him back -- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone.\", 'He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.', '\"Who\\'s there?\"', 'squawked the Fat Lady.', 'Harry said nothing.', 'He walked quickly down the corridor.', 'Where should he go?', 'He stopped, his heart racing, and thought.', 'And then it came to him.', 'The Restricted Section in the library.', \"He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.\", 'He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.', 'The library was pitch-black and very eerie.', 'Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books.', 'The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.', 'The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library.', 'Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.', \"They didn't tell him much.\", \"Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand.\", 'Some had no title at all.', 'One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.', \"The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled.\", \"Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.\", 'He had to start somewhere.', 'Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book.', 'A large black and silver volume caught his eye.', 'He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.', 'A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming!', 'Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.', 'He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once.', 'Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it.', \"He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.\", 'He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.', \"He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going.\", \"Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all.\", 'There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.', '\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library Restricted Section.\"', 'Harry felt the blood drain out of his face.', 'Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section?', 'Well, they can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\"', 'Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.', \"They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid.\", 'He backed away as quietly as he could.', 'A door stood ajar to his left.', 'It was his only hope.', 'He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything.', 'They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away.', 'That had been close, very close.', 'It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.', 'It looked like an unused classroom.', \"The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\", 'It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.', 'There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.', 'His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.', 'He stepped in front of it.', 'He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming.', 'He whirled around.', 'His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.', 'But the room was empty.', 'Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.', 'There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others.', 'Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there.', 'Or were they all invisible, too?', \"Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\", 'He looked in the mirror again.', 'A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving.', 'He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him.', \"If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror.\", 'She was a very pretty woman.', 'She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass.', 'Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time.', 'The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her.', 'He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy.', \"It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.\", 'Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.', '\"Mom?\"', 'he whispered.', '\"Dad?\"', 'They just looked at him, smiling.', \"And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\", 'The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.', 'He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.', \"How long he stood there, he didn't know.\", 'The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.', \"He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed.\", 'He tore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll come back,\" \\n\\nand hurried from the room.', '\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.', '\"You can come tonight, I\\'m going back, I want to show you the mirror.', '\"I\\'d like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly.', '\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\"', '\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron.', '\"Just come round my house this summer.', 'Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people.', 'Shame about not finding Flamel, though.', 'Have some bacon or something, why aren\\'t you eating anything?\"', \"Harry couldn't eat.\", 'He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight.', 'He had almost forgotten about Flamel.', \"It didn't seem very important anymore.\", 'Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?', 'What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?', '\"Are you all right?\"', 'said Ron.', '\"You look odd.\"', 'What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again.', 'With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.', \"They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\", '\"I\\'m freezing,\" said Ron.', '\"Let\\'s forget it and go back.\"', '\"No!\"', 'Harry hissed.', 'I know it\\'s here somewhere.\"', 'They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else.', 'just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.', '\"It\\'s here -- just here -- yes!\"', 'They pushed the door open.', 'Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.', 'There they were.', 'His mother and father

properly, go on, stand where I am.\"', \"Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\", 'Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.', '\"Look at me!\"', 'he said.', '\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"', '\"No -- I\\'m alone -- but I\\'m different -- I look older -- and I\\'m head boy!\"', '\"What?\"', '\"I am -- I\\'m wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I\\'m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I\\'m Quidditch captain, too.', 'Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid

night, give me a bit more time.\"', '\"You\\'re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\'s interesting about that?', 'I want to see my parents.\"', '\"Don\\'t push me --\" \\n\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.', \"They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.\", '\"Quick!\"', 'Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door.', 'Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats?', 'After what seemed an age, she turned and left.', '\"This isn\\'t safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.', 'Come on.\"', 'And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.', \"The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.\", '\"Want to play chess, Harry?\"', 'said Ron.',

mirror.', 'There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family.', 'Nothing at all.', 'Except -- \"So -- back again, Harry?\"', 'Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice.', 'He looked behind him.', 'Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.', 'Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\\'t noticed him. \\n\\n\"', '-- I didn\\'t see you, sir.\"', '\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.',

called that, Sir.\"', '\"But I expect you\\'ve realized by now what it does?\"', '\"It -- well -- it shows me my family --\" \\n\\n\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\"', '\"How did you know --?\"', '\"I don\\'t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently.', '\"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"', 'Harry shook his head.', '\"Let me explain.', 'The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.', 'Does that help?\"', 'Harry thought.', 'Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want... \\n\\nwhatever we want...\" \\n\\n\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly.', '\"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.', 'You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.', 'Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.', 'However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.', 'Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.', '\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again.', 'If you ever do run across it, you will now be

mirror?\"', '\"I?', 'I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"', 'Harry stared.', '\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"Another Christmas has come and gone and I

again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk.', \"Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't.\", 'He started having nightmares.', 'Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.', '\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.', 'Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.',

who Nicolas Flamel was.', \"They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.\", 'Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks.', 'Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.', 'Wood was working the team harder than ever.', \"Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits.\", \"The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side.\", 'If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years.', 'Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.', 'Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news.', \"He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\", '\"Will you stop messing around!\"', 'he yelled.', '\"That\\'s exactly the sort of thing that\\'ll lose us the match!', 'Snape\\'s refereeing this time, and he\\'ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"', 'George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.', '\"Snape\\'s refereeing?\"', 'he spluttered through a mouthful of mud.', '\"When\\'s he ever refereed a Quidditch match?', 'He\\'s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\"', 'The rest of the team

all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....', 'The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.', 'Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.', '\"Don\\'t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen --\" He caught sight of Harry\\'s face.', '\"What\\'s the matter

decoration,\" said Hermione.', 'They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?', '\"They\\'re not birds!\"', 'Harry said suddenly.', '\"They\\'re keys!', 'Winged keys -- look carefully.', 'So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys.', '\"... yes -- look!', 'Broomsticks!', 'We\\'ve got to catch the key to the door!\"', '\"But there are hundreds of them!\"', 'Ron examined the lock on the door.', '\"We\\'re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.\"', 'They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys.', 'They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.', 'Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.', \"He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't.\", \"After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of

one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"', 'Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.', '\"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\"', 'Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing.', '\"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and catch it.', 'Right, NOW!\"', 'Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.', \"Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.\", 'They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand.', 'He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked.', 'The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.', '\"Ready?\"', 'Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.', 'They nodded.', 'He pulled the door open.', \"The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all.\", 'But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.', 'They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone.', 'Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces.', 'Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces.', '\"Now what do we do?\"', 'Harry whispered.', '\"It\\'s obvious, isn\\'t it?\"', 'said Ron.', '\"We\\'ve got to play our way across the room.\"', 'Behind the white pieces they could see another door.', '\"How?\"', 'said Hermione nervously.', '\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we\\'re going to have to be chessmen.\"', \"He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse.\", 'At once, the stone sprang to life.', 'The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.', '\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\"', 'The black knight nodded.', 'Ron turned to the other two.', '\"This needs thinking about he said.', 'I suppose we\\'ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces....\" \\n\\nHarry

knight,\" said Ron.', 'The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.', '\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.', '\"Yes... look...\" \\n\\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.', 'Ron started to direct the black pieces.', 'They moved silently wherever he sent them.', \"Harry's knees were trembling.\", 'What if they lost?', '\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"', 'Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken.', 'The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.', '\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken.', '\"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"', 'Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.', 'Soon there

gone, he can't use it.\", 'Have a Chocolate Frog, I\\'ve got loads....\" \\n\\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds me.', 'I\\'ve got yeh a present.\"', '\"It\\'s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\"', 'said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.', '\"Nah.', 'Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it.', '\\'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this...\" \\n\\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book.', 'Harry opened it curiously.', 'It was full of wizard photographs.', 'Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.', '\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\' old school friends, askin\\' fer photos... knew yeh didn\\' have any... d\\'yeh like it?\"', \"Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.\", 'Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.', \"He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.\", \"It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row.\", 'A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.', 'When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once.', 'He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.', 'Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later.', 'The babble died away.', '\"Another year gone!\"', 'Dumbledore said cheerfully.', '\"And I must trouble you with an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast.', 'What a year it has been!', 'Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.... \\n\\n\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\"', 'A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.', 'Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table.', 'It was a sickening sight.', '\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"', 'The room went very still.', \"The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\", '\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"I have a few last-minute points to dish out.', 'Let me see.', 'Yes... \\n\\n\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\" \\n\\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.', '\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"', 'Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver.', 'Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know!', 'My youngest brother!', 'Got past McGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\"', 'At last there was silence again.', '\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"', 'Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears.', 'Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up.', '\"Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore.', 'The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"', 'The din was deafening.', 'Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin.', 'They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.', 'Dumbledore raised his hand.', 'The room gradually fell silent.', '\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling.', '\"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.', 'I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"', 'Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table.', 'Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.', 'He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.', \"Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\", '\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\"', 'He clapped his hands.', 'In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place.', \"Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile.\", \"He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot.\", \"This didn't worry Harry.\", 'It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.', \"It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.\", 'Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did.', 'To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.', 'Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one.', 'They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too.', \"It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.\", 'And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\\'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they\\'ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\'s Cross Station.', 'It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform.', \"A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\", '\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I\\'ll send you an owl.\"', '\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\"', 'People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world.', 'Some of them called: \"Bye, Harry!\"', '\"See you, Potter!\"', '\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.', '\"Not where I\\'m going, I promise you,\" said Harry.', 'He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.', '\"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\"', \"It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron.\", '\"Harry Potter!\"', 'she squealed.', '\"Look, Mom!', 'I can see \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\'s rude to point.\"', 'Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.', '\"Busy year?\"', 'she said.', '\"Very,\" said Harry.', '\"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.', 'Weasley.\"', '\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"', '\"Ready, are you?\"', 'It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.', 'Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.', '\"You must be Harry\\'s family!\"', 'said Mrs. Weasley.', '\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon.', '\"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\'t got all day.\"', 'He walked away.', 'Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.', '\"See you over the summer, then.\"', '\"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.', '\"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face.', '\"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use magic at home.', 'I\\'m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer....\" \\n\\nTHE END']\n"
