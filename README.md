   ```
2. You are ready to go!

## Assignments

### Assignment 1

**Title:** Research and Preprocessing Steps

**Description:** This assignment includes a summary of the paper "Abstractive Summarization Guided by Latent Hierarchical Document Structure." Additionally, it covers preprocessing steps for English and Farsi, followed by a spell checker implementation.

**Files:**
- `Assignment1/Research/Research.pdf`: Summary of the paper.
- `Assignment1/Codes/Preprocessing_Fa.py`: Preprocessing steps for Farsi.
- `Assignment1/Codes/Preprocessing_Eng.py`: Preprocessing steps for English.
- `Assignment1/Codes/SpellChecker.py`: Spell checker code.

### Assignment 2

**Title:** Autofill and POS Tagging

**Description:** This assignment involves creating an autofill feature using n-gram modeling on the Digikala comments dataset. It also includes a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger.

**Files:**
- `Assignment2/Codes/AutoFiller.py`: Autofill implementation using n-gram modeling.
- `Assignment2/Codes/POS_Tagging.py`: POS tagger code.

### Assignment 3

**Title:** Sentiment Analysis using RNNs

**Description:** This assignment focuses on sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Both SimpleRNN and LSTM architectures are utilized to analyze sentiments in the given dataset.

**Files:**
- `Assignment3/Codes/Sentiment_Analysis.py`: Sentiment analysis using SimpleRNN.

### Assignment 4

**Title:** Fine-Tuning wav2vec 2.0

**Description:** This assignment involves fine-tuning the wav2vec 2.0 model (xlsr-53) using the Common Voice Mozilla Persian dataset.

**Files:**
- `Assignment4/Codes/ASR_fa_v1.py`: Code for fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0. (v1)
- `Assignment4/Codes/ASR_fa_v2.py`: Code for fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0. (v2 - main)

## Additional Resources

### Course Slides

The course slides provide a comprehensive overview of the topics covered in the course taught by Dr.Baradaran. They are available in the `Course Slides` directory.

### Presentation

A presentation on LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is included in the `Presentation` directory, containing the report, PowerPoint, and code. (with the help of DeepLearning.AI)

### Source Folder

The `Source` folder contains Jurafsky's NLP book, a valuable resource for understanding the theoretical foundations of NLP.
